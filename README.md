# election-projection
This is a simple experimental tool to extrapolate the final result of the US presidential election based on first results and exit polls in individual states.
The model is in principle based on the same methods used in Germany and some other countries to extrapolate the result of an election after polling stations have closed, many hours before the final result is known. Columns B and C in rows 2 to 7 show the results achieved by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016 in six states (figures in percent). In these states, the polling stations will be the first to close. As soon as first results from these states are available, they can be entered in columns E and F. The current results are then automatically divided by the 2016 results. These figures are then automatically weighted according to the number of inhabitants in the states. Finally, they are multiplied by the national final result of 2016. This results in the extrapolation for the entire USA (columns E and F, line 11). The same is done for 13 battleground or swing states (columns E and F, lines 13 to 25).
